# Project of the Week: DVC
## Overview
This repository documents my progress following the Project of the Week by DataTalksClub, focusing on Data Version Control (DVC).

Project Guideline Link: [#project-of-the-week](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2024-05-22-DVC.md)

### Why DVC?
DVC helps data scientists adopt best practices for organizing their projects and collaborating effectively by:
- Tracking and saving data and ML models similarly to code.
- Creating and switching between versions of data and ML models effortlessly.
- Understanding how datasets and ML artifacts were initially built.
- Comparing model metrics among experiments.
- Adopting engineering tools and best practices in data science projects.

## Day 1: Preparation
### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create a GitHub repository
    - Repository: [project-of-the-week-dvc](https://github.com/saifulrijal-ds/project-of-the-week-dvc)
- [x] Install DVC in your own OS with [2]
    - Prerequisite: Git must be installed.
    ```bash
    git --version
    # git version 2.43.0
    ```
    To install Git:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```
    - Create Conda environment and install DVC:
    ```bash
    conda create --name dvc_env
    conda activate dvc_env
    conda install -c conda-forge dvc
    ```
    - Install additional storage plugins:
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge dvc-s3 dvc-oss
    ```
    - Verify DVC installation:
    ```bash
    dvc --version
    # 3.50.2
    ```
- [x] Understand and run Data version control capabilities (with custom data for example txt or csv) check out [1] and [3].Â Friendly reminder: DVC is not just a version control tool it also contains experimentation, pipelines, and more.

- [x] Share your progress in Slack and on social media.


DVC Practice Workflow
Step-by-Step Guide
Create a sample data file (data/data.txt):

kotlin
Copy code
First version of data
Initialize DVC:

bash
Copy code
dvc init
Creates .dvc and .dvcignore folders.
Add file to DVC tracking:

bash
Copy code
dvc add data/data.txt
Creates .gitignore and data.txt.dvc.
Adds a reference link in the .dvc/cache folder.
Modify the data file:

kotlin
Copy code
First version of data. (modified)
Add the changed file:
bash
Copy code
dvc add data/data.txt
Commit changes to Git:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated data.txt with modifications"
Further modify the data file:

sql
Copy code
First version of data. (modified)
Second edition
Add the modified file:
bash
Copy code
dvc add data/data.txt
Commit changes:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Added second edition to data.txt"
Rollback data changes:

Find the previous commit ID:
bash
Copy code
git log
Checkout the desired commit:
bash
Copy code
git checkout {commit_id}
Restore the data:
bash
Copy code
dvc checkout
Return to the main branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
dvc checkout
Using AWS S3 as Remote Storage for DVC
Configuration Steps
Configure AWS profile:

bash
Copy code
aws configure --profile dvc-s3-profile
Add S3 remote storage:

bash
Copy code
dvc remote add -d myremote s3://saiful-dvc-remote-bucket/project-of-the-week-dvc/
Modify the remote to use the AWS profile:

bash
Copy code
dvc remote modify myremote --local profile dvc-s3-profile
Note: The --local flag ensures this configuration is not tracked by Git.
Verify the setup:

Add a new data file (data/bank-marketing.csv) and track with DVC:
bash
Copy code
dvc add data/bank-marketing.csv
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Added bank-marketing.csv and tracked with DVC"
Push DVC cache to remote:
bash
Copy code
dvc push
Check the S3 bucket for the uploaded data.
